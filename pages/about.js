            Born and raised in the city of Lagos, which is famous for gifting the world
            the musical genius of Fela Kuti, Diazno would come to discover his love for
            music and a fondness for the guitar in his early teens. What seemed to be a
            teenage fling quite dramatically morphed into raw passion which saw him
            abandon all other thoughts and firmly set his sights on a career in music.

            Demonstrating his brilliant work ethic, Diazno graduated top of his class at
            the prestigious school of music, Musical Society of Nigeria (MUSON). His
            academic success was swiftly met with incredible opportunities, including
            working as music director for various acts at the Lagos Theatre Festival and
            the Lagos International Jazz Festival. Not to mention, receiving a teaching
            position at MUSON.

            Following a move to Berlin in the summer of 2016, other aspects of his
            musicianship would begin to unravel. The classically-trained musician
            developed his craft into a singer/songwriter whose vocals have drawn strong
            comparisons to John Legend. An artist not afraid of boundaries, Diaznoâ€™s
            music is a daring mix of afro-influenced Pop/Rock with a hint of soul and
            reggae.
