        Born and raised in the city of Lagos, which is famous for gifting the world the
        musical genius of Fela Kuti, Diazno would come to discover his love for music
        and a fondness for the guitar in his early teens. What seemed to be a teenage
        fling quite dramatically morphed into raw passion which saw him abandon all
        other thoughts and firmly set his sights on a career in music.

        Demonstrating his brilliant work ethic, Diazno graduated top of his class at the
        prestigious school of music, Musical Society of Nigeria (MUSON). His academic
        success was swiftly met with incredible opportunities, including working as
        music director for various acts at the Lagos Theatre Festival and the Lagos
        International Jazz Festival. Not to mention, receiving a teaching position at
        MUSON.

        Following a move to Berlin in the summer of 2016, other aspects of his
        musicianship would begin to unravel. The classically-trained musician developed
        his craft into a singer/songwriter whose vocals have drawn strong comparisons to
        John Legend. An artist not afraid of boundaries, Diaznoâ€™s music is a daring mix
        of afro-influenced Pop/Rock with a hint of soul and reggae.
